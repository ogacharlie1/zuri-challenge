            <p> I am charles. An engineer and software developer currently participating in the zuri program which helps to nurture
              young talents into the tech world. It has been a dream to acquire a skill in tech and now, i can only hope to get
              better in it and hope for better days ahead. </p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            As a fun loving person, what i enjoy doing the most is travelling because you learn alot from just going around.
            Another is reading, then meeting people who will impact in my life positively.
            </p>

            <h5>Skills</h5>
            I have always had an interest in picking up new skills and this has made me become very handy in the use of most
            machines and tools. And currently, adding to the catalogue of skills is the coding skill.
